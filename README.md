# Ultrasonic-White-Cane

Our team of four was tasked with designing a device to improve the quality of life for either Tim, a visually impaired man with neuropathy and diabetes, or Kim, a manually disabled individual with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Our final prototypes were required to show promising results and to have contributed to enhancing the life of either the one of mentioned individuals with disabilities.

After thorough research and brainstorming, we decided to focus on creating a smart cane for Tim that would use sensors and artificial intelligence to detect obstacles and provide audio feedback.

Attached below is the final device demonstration video (SOUND ON), alongside an image:
